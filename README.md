a simple weather app project for TOP, this project is reather simple but is part of the TOP
cariculum becuase of the new programming concepts being taught and implamented for the first time.

new things I will be using:

-   API to gather weather data
-   asynchronus programming which inlcudes:
    -   promises
    -   async/await
    -   call backs (not used much here though)
-   I will also be transpilling scss into css using babel for the first time

will write more later...
